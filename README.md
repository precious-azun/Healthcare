Top rising diseases like Stroke have been a leading cause of death and disability in the world today with an increasing number of cases in which 1 out of 4 adults over 25years of age will have a stroke in their lifetime. As this is a rising global crisis, it thus needs an urgent response in ways of research for early detection and treatment.

Machine Learning algorithms play a crucial role in Healthcare by forecasting the presence/absence of global-rising diseases like stroke, cancer, heart failure, etc. If well expected in advance, such needed knowledge will offer valuable guidance to physicians who can then change their procedure and treat the patient appropriately. The healthcare system is peculiar and Iâ€™m keen on its development.
