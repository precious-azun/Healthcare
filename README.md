Today, diseases pose a great threat to our world and Stroke is one of the top threats. The stroke statistics published by the CDC https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm show that every 40seconds, someone has a stroke in the United States, and every 3.5 minutes, a stroke-related death occurs. Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke and about 610,000 of these are first or new strokes.Â 

However, it is not all gloom and doom. Simple lifestyle changes (such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, maintaining blood sugar and cholesterol levels within normal ranges, exercising regularly, and eating healthily) coupled with early treatment could greatly reduce the risk of stroke. The multifaceted nature of many risk factors, such as diabetes, high BMI, elevated cholesterol, etc., makes it hard to identify high-risk patients. As this is an emerging global crisis, research for early detection and treatment is essential and that is where machine learning and data mining come into play.

As a result of machine learning algorithms, healthcare professionals can anticipate the presence or absence of these top rising diseases and in this case Stroke. Knowing such information in advance will provide valuable guidance to physicians, who can then change their procedures as necessary and treat the patient appropriately.
This article will demonstrate how different Machine Learning Algorithms can be applied to develop a screening tool for predicting whether a patient has a 5-year risk of developing Stroke disease. This article's source is available in this repository
